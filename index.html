      Hello Professor, I am Vanbawi! I have taken a few courses with you and
      have learned so much from your great courses! I am a person who loves
      picking up and learning new things. Hearing about all the things we are
      going to learn this semester makes me so excited. I hope all the skills
      and technologies I learn this semester will help me grow as a professional
      and help me break into the tech industry. I am looking forward to another
      great semester with you!
    </p>
